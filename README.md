# Science museum

In this project I was given the task to make a site for a science museum in my hometown. I made a page called Oslo Science Museum using only Html and Css. I was Given pictures and text and was told to use this at my disposal. I started with a scetch on figma, and then made a prototype. After this I made a navbar witch is responsive for mobile devices. I used a green colour as a theme. I was very pleased with this site, being easy to navigate and use the page, as the page is ment for all age groups.
